To do list for winter semester:
	Write first chunk of program to test the shaders - done
	Create model - done (human and plane)
	Find out why tesselation shader is not working - in progress
	Test the tesselation shader on the plane
	Rewrite the c++ code to create simple window with some interaction
	Find out why you can't import the color tiff file
	
Warning
	I am still using hard links to everything, so you might need to rewrite them in .hpp file.
